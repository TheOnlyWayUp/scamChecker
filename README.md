# scamChecker
Check a discord message and give it a percentage of scamminess

Run the bot, and run the command !scamCheck <any text here> and it will return a percentage of suspiciousness along with some reasons, feel free to use the function in your own, would appreciate if you could link my github as a comment if you do though :)
